# Basketball Scene Drawing with Pycairo

This project uses Python and the Pycairo library to draw a detailed basketball hoop with a backboard, stand, net, and ball. The generated image includes various components, each created through specific drawing functions to form a complete basketball scene.

## Project Structure

- `draw_background`: Sets the background color.
- `draw_hoop`: Draws the main hoop with an outline.
- `draw_net_line1` to `draw_net_line6`: Draws the curved lines representing the net.
- `draw_backboard`: Creates the backboard with a glowing effect.
- `draw_inner_rectangle`: Draws an inner rectangle within the backboard.
- `draw_stand`: Draws the stand for the hoop and backboard.
- `draw_connector`: Adds a connector between the stand and the hoop.
- `draw_sphere`: Creates a spherical ball with gradient shading for light reflection.
